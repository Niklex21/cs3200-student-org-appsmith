### APPsmith UI ReadMe

No authentication is required. For Appsmith, we have created 3 profiles in the main menu for each user persona. This includes Prospective Club Member, Greek Life Org President, and Club Sports President. For Club Sport President, when you click on it you will see a directory for managing E-board positions as well as a calendar to edit and add events. If you click prospective member, you can see a list of all active clubs with the type of club also listed. Prospective members can state their interest on each club using the "plus" button on the top right after selecting a club. For Greek Life President, you can view dues, amounts already paid and you can also add and remove members by clicking the edit icon.
